Twitter-Inspired Post Project
______________________________________________

The challenge with this particular project was to build an application where a user can sign in (if possible), create posts (if possible), and perform other CRUD actions, all while not looking at books, tutorials, or refrences for assistance.

The most challenging part of this project was being able to build out the views to show the information that the user would want to see. I was unable to render and display the content for the micropost once a post had been created. 

From this challenge I have been able to build and solidfy some of the core components of building an application.
